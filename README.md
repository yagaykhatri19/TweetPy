# TweetPy - Tweet Classification Web App
Imagine having a tool that understands tweets at a deeper level, sorting them into specific categories like News, Events, Opinions, Deals, and Private Messages. TweetPy is precisely that toolâ€”a smart text classifier that helps categorize tweets to quickly understand their main purpose.

This project is a tweet classification web application built using Flask, machine learning models, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
