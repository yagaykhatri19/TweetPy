# TweetPy - Tweet Classification Web App
Imagine having a tool that understands tweets at a deeper level, sorting them into specific categories like News, Events, Opinions, Deals, and Private Messages. TweetPy is precisely that toolâ€”a smart text classifier that helps categorize tweets to quickly understand their main purpose.

This project is a tweet classification web application built using Flask, machine learning models, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Python 3.x (Preferably Python 3.8 or later)
- Git (for cloning from GitHub, if using Option 1)

## Running the Project

### Option 1: Running from GitHub
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yagaykhatri19/TweetPy.git
   cd TweetPy

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On Mac/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate

3. Install the required dependencies using requirements.txt:

   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
    python app.py

Open your browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to see the web application in action.

### Option 2: Running from a ZIP file
1. Download and unzip the project files.

2. Navigate to the project folder and create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On Mac/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate

3. Install the required dependencies using requirements.txt:

   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
    python app.py

Open your browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to see the web application in action.

## Technologies Used
- Flask: A micro web framework for building the web app.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Ensemble Models).
- NLTK: For natural language processing tasks like tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- Joblib: For saving and loading machine learning models.
